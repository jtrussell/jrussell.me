## this guy

Hello! I'm a software engineer and web developer living in the Boston area.
Since graduating from Colby College, Waterville ME, in 2009 I've worked full
time for [iVantage Health Analtics][ivantage]. We specialize in data driven,
rich internet applications.

If I'm not at the keyboard chances are good you'll find me playing
[squash][squash-profile] or frisbee.
